Each class spec is made up of a `.md` which contains the sequence(s) for the class and talent points.  Additionally, it has one or more `.raw` files that are the raw view of a single version of the macro.  The `.raw` files are **not** required to import, but simply allow us to have a quick view of a macro and better git history of each macro.
